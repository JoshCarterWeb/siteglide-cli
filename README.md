# Siteglide CLI

Siteglide CLI is a tool that enables you to work on your project from your local editor and has similar behaviours to that of using FTP, in that you can sync up and pull down changes from your website. You will be required to use some terminal commands to use this feature.

For features and setup instructions, see our help documentation [here](https://developers.siteglide.com/introducing-siteglide-cli)
